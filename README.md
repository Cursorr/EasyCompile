# EasyCompile

EasyCompile is a bash script designed to facilitate the compilation of C programs, following the compilation standards provided by [@rnollet](https://github.com/rnollet)
, without the need to manually copy all the flags (although it is still recommended to learn them).

# How to install it?

Installing EasyCompile is quite easy. Simply download the "easycompile.sh" file. Once that's done, you should run the command chmod u+x easycompile.sh in the same directory as the file to make the script executable.

To fully benefit from the program, we will move it to /bin so that it can be used from any directory. Administrative permission is required to access /bin, so we will execute the command in sudo (admin) mode -> sudo cp easycompile.sh /bin, and that's it!

# How does it work?

It's the easiest part. You just need to run the command "easycompile" from any directory, followed by the name of the C file, and you're good to go.

So, what are you waiting for? Get typing on your keyboards!
